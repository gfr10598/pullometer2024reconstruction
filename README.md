# Basic I2C Master Example

(See the README.md file in the upper level 'examples' directory for more information about examples.)

## Overview

This example demonstrates basic usage of I2C driver by reading and writing from a I2C connected sensor:

If you have a new I2C application to go (for example, read the temperature data from external sensor with I2C interface), try this as a basic template, then add your own code.

## How to use example

### Hardware Required

To run this example, you should have an Espressif development board based on a chip listed in supported targets as well as a MPU9250. MPU9250 is a inertial measurement unit, which contains a accelerometer, gyroscope as well as a magnetometer, for more information about it, you can read the [datasheet of the MPU9250 sensor](https://invensense.tdk.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/PS-MPU-9250A-01-v1.1.pdf).

#### Pin Assignment

**Note:** The following pin assignments are used by default, you can change these in the `menuconfig` .

|                  | SDA             | SCL           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| ESP I2C Master   | I2C_MASTER_SDA | I2C_MASTER_SCL |
| MPU9250 Sensor   | SDA            | SCL            |

For the actual default value of `I2C_MASTER_SDA` and `I2C_MASTER_SCL` see `Example Configuration` in `menuconfig`.

**Note:** There's no need to add an external pull-up resistors for SDA/SCL pin, because the driver will enable the internal pull-up resistors.

### Build and Flash

Enter `idf.py -p PORT flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.

## Example Output

```bash
I (328) example: I2C initialized successfully
I (338) example: WHO_AM_I = 71
I (338) example: I2C de-initialized successfully
```

## Troubleshooting

(For any technical queries, please open an [issue](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues) on GitHub. We will get back to you as soon as possible.)

## Notes:
- Used vscode extension to create the project
- Used idf.py add-dependency arduino-esp32 to add arduino as component.
- project defaulted to the wrong idf version, based on idf.py --version
    - consequently, the arduino-esp32 component wouldn't compile.
- used vscode Select Current ESP-IDF Version to change the to 5.5.1
- manually changed the version in the idf_component.yml file.

Then
- replaced template code with old code
- idf.py add-dependency again, and updated version requirements
- deleted old main.c
- idf.py fullclean && idf.py build - BUILDS!!

Make sure to use the 5.5.1 (or later) version of ESP_IDF tools.

A lot of code is now in ./managed_components/espressif__arduino-esp32/libraries/,
including things like Wire.  It does not need to be saved in git, because the build
process will download it, based on the arduino-esp32 dependency.

Now, how do we add the LSM library?  I'm trying it out as a git submodule, under components,
with a CMakeLists file to create an idf component.
However, it looks like I wrote a bit of extra code in the LSM...cpp file that doesn't exist
in the STMicro code.  

It seems to compile fine if I delete my copies of lsm*.h and lsm*.c files, and let the LSM*.cpp 
pick those up from the component.  Yay!  Still need to test it on a copy of the hardware.
